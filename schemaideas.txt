Schema for Task List

* Schema is to have two tables initially:
    * Lists
    * Tasks

This database will be constructed in SQLite3.

Tables:

Lists
listId (Pk) INT
listName VARCHAR 255

Tasks
taskId (Pk) INT
listId (Fk) INT
description VARCHAR 255
priority CHAR(1)
category1 VARCHAR 255
category2 VARCHAR 255
dueDate DATETIME
completionStatus TINYINT(1)

# Category 1 is the primary category of task (ie. Home, Work, etc.)
# Category 2 is a subcategory of Category 1 (ie. Cooking, cleaning, Linux projects, etc.)

Additional table will be required for completed tasks. Tasks marked with completionStatus of 1 will be DROPPED from the tasks table, then added to this new table (completedTasks).
